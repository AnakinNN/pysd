Vensim Translation
==================

My goal is to translate the subset of Vensim functionality that has an equivalent in XMILE.
There are some constructs (such as tagging variables as 'suplementary' which are not currently
parsed.

The vensim import function :py:func:`pysd.read_vensim` lists currently supported functionality.
