PySD-Cookbook
-------------
A collection of simple recipes for advanced data analytics using PySD is available at: https://github.com/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook

The cookbook includes models, sample data, and code in the form of ipython notebooks that demonstrate a variety of data integration and analysis tasks, including:

* `Getting started with PySD and the Python data analytics stack <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook/blob/master/1_2_Installation_and_Setup.ipynb>`_
* `Basic PySD usage' <'http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook/blob/master/1_3_Hello_World_Teacup.ipynb>`_
* `Optimizing models with run-at-a-time data fitting <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook/blob/master/2_1_Fitting_with_Optimization.ipynb>`_
* `Optimizing models with step-at-a-time data fitting <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook/blob/master/2_2_Step_at_a_time_optimization.ipynb>`_
* `Fitting and exploring models across geographic scales <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook/blob/master/Exploring%20models%20across%20geographic%20scales.ipynb>`_
* `Surrogating SD model components with machine learning regression models <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesPHoughton/PySD-Cookbook/blob/master/6_1_Surrogating_with_regression.ipynb>`_

These models can be executed on your local machine, and modified to suit your particular analysis requirements.
